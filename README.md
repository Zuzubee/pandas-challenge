Observable Trends

1. The dataset encompasses a total of 15 schools, 39,170 students. The total students average reading score is 81.87 which is higher than the average math score 78.98. When we see the passing rate reading (85.80%) has a higher rate than math (74.98 %), the overall passing rate is 65.17%. These findings indicate that student's score more in reading than math.


2. The school summary finding showed that from 15 schools 7 of them are found at the district level, and the other 8 of them found at the charter level. The number of students in schools ranged between 427 students (Holden High School) to 4976 students (Bailey High School). The general finding also showed that district schools have more students than charter schools. It is legitimate to conclude that district schools have more students than charter schools because of their geographical coverage.


3. The total budget field of the school summery showed the amount of money each school consumed. The maximum budget is $3,124,928.00 its Bailey High School, and the lower budget is $248,087.00 its Holden High School. We can see later Bailey High School is not in the top performing schools. The schools budget allocaters,and Bailey High School should to be work on this to improve the quality. Regarding budget per student, Huang High School ($655.000) has a higher budget per student, and Wilson High School ($578.00) allocates a lower budget per student. Huang High School is one of the bottom performing school the same as Bailey High School it one area for future improvement to see education quality as it budgetd. The total district schools budget ($17,347,923.00) is higher than Charter schools budget ($7,301,505.00), however, when we come to the total allocation of Budget Per Student charter schools allocation ($4,796.00) is greater than district schools ($4,505.00). This may due to charter schools have a smaller number of students.


4. The findings from the data showed that in all metrics (average, percent, and overall) of reading and math scores Charter schools have a greater score than District schools. Pena High School has the maximum (83.839917) average math score (83.839917), percent of students passing math (94.59%) and average reading score (84.044699). This implies that Pena High School has a good quality, and reputation in teaching math, and reading. On the other side, Huang High School has a lower average math score (76.842711), and percent of students passing math (65.683922). Regarding the percent of passing reading class Thomas High School has a higher percentage value (97.30%). On the flip side, Rodriguez High School has a lower Average Reading Score (80.744686), and Ford High School has a lower passing reading. In the overall percentage passing Cabrera High School has the maximum passing percentage rate (91.33 %), and Rodriguez High School has a lower percentage of (52.98) passing.


5. Grade 11 students at Holden High School holds a higher average Math score (85) comparing all schools and grades. Holden High School grade 12 students possess a higher average reading score (84.698795).


6. The other irregular finding of this analysis is that when the budget per student increases student's average math score, the average reading score, percent of passing math, percent of passing reading, and the overall passing decreases. This finding commences investigating the real motivators for academic achievement, and give an open space for researchers to work on this more.


7. The data revealed that when the number of students sizes higher in schools the average math scores, average reading scores, passing math, passing reading, and overall passing decrease. So, we can infer that, when student size rises, it negatively influences student achievement. Therefore, schools, cities, districts, and charters should work on student size in schools, and classes because it directly affects student achievement for so many reasons.
